            Do Not Track Notice
          </div>
          <div>
            Do Not Track ("DNT") is a preference available in many web browsers
            which allows you to inform websites you visit that you do not want
            them collecting information about you. OnMyWay does not respond to
            DNT signals. For further details regarding DNT, visit donottrack.us.

          <div>
            OnMyWay is always improving. As the OnMyWay Services evolve we may
            occasionally update this privacy policy. If we modify this privacy
            policy, we will post the revised privacy policy to the website, and
            we will also revise the "last updated date" stated above. If we make
            material changes in the way we use personal information, we will
            notify you by posting an announcement on our mobile application or
            website or by sending you an e-mail. It is your responsibility to
            periodically review this privacy policy; users are bound by any
            changes to the privacy policy by using the OnMyWay Services after
            such changes have been first posted.
