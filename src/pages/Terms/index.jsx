                Application Marketplace Providers and their subsidiaries are
                third-party beneficiaries of this agreement, and that they have
                the right (and are deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce

                needs to protect the program for all users by ensuring that
                points are earned for legitimate consumer transactions. OnMyWay
                users are permitted to earn money with OnMyWay in connection
                with spending activity for non-commercial, personal and
                household purposes (“Qualifying Transactions”). OnMyWay users
                are not permitted to earn money with OnMyWay for commercial
                purposes (e.g., in connection with a business). OnMyWay
                maintains the right to review the accrual of money and to
                determine, in OnMyWay’s absolute discretion, if certain
                transactions qualify for OnMyWay Offers. Certain spending
                including, but not limited to, repeat purchases, high-value
                purchases, purchases of gift cards, and purchases made for
                commercial, non-personal or non-household purposes, may not, at
                OnMyWay’s absolute discretion, be considered Qualifying
                Transactions and may be ineligible for OnMyWay rewards. OnMyWay
                may reverse point accruals that have already been processed if a
                transaction is deemed by OnMyWay, upon review, to not constitute
                a Qualifying Transaction. OnMyWay may also disable accounts that
                engage in repeated non-Qualifying Transaction activity.
